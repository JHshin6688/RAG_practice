## Overview
NFL RAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model designed to provide real-time NFL news updates without requiring users to manually search for the latest information. The model extracts news links from the official NFL news page, builds a vector database using the collected articles, and generates the most relevant responses based on user queries while maintaining conversational context.
